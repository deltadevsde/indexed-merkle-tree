# Indexed Merkle Tree

## Overview

The Indexed Merkle Tree crate provides a robust implementation of indexed Merkle trees in particular described for [Transparency Dictionaries](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1263.pdf) that can be used for various cryptographic applications. Compared to normal Merkle trees, this implementation provides proofs for both membership and non-membership, ensuring uniqueness of leaf nodes.
